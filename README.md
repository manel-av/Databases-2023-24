# Databases - Modernist Shopping Center Project
## About This Course
This comprehensive database design course focused on creating a complete relational database system for a modern shopping center in Sant Cugat del Vallès. Through hands-on work, we learned to model complex real-world scenarios using entity-relationship diagrams and implement them in SQL.

## Practical Work
### Conceptual Design Phase (Weeks 1-2)
We developed the core database structure:
- Identified 14 key entities (Clients, Cars, Parking, Stores, Products, etc.)
- Designed relationships between entities (1:N, N:M, weak entities)
- Created a complete ER diagram
- Added custom attributes for business needs (parking spot numbering, ticket references)

### Logical Design Phase (Weeks 3-4)
We transformed the conceptual model into a relational schema:
- Created 17 tables with proper data types
- Established 19 foreign key constraints
- Implemented business rules through:
  - Composite primary keys
  - Null constraints
  - Referential integrity

- Designed special relationships:
  - Parking stays (weak entity)
  - Store rentals (historical tracking)
  - Product bundles (pack relationships)

### Implementation Phase (Weeks 5-6)
We built the complete database system:
- Wrote comprehensive SQL DDL scripts
- Created test data for all scenarios
- Developed 10 analytical queries including:
  - Parking availability
  - Customer spending patterns
  - Employee performance metrics
  - Interactive store mapping

## Working Environment
We used:
- Oracle Database 19c
- SQL Developer
- ER modeling tools

## Final Thoughts
From initial requirements gathering to complex analytical queries, this project gave us complete experience in database development. The progressive approach (conceptual → logical → implementation) made the complex shopping center ecosystem manageable.
